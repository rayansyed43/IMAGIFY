# IMAGIFY
- IMAGIFY is a text-to-image project that uses a dreamlike-art model, which helps us recreate our text into images with proper workflow.
- We use the Euler Ancestral Discrete Scheduler, which is a fast scheduler that can often generate good outputs in 20â€“30 steps.
- A latent diffusion model known as Stable Diffusion is used to reduce memory and compute complexity.
- A Python library called "Better Profanity" is used for cleaning swear words.
